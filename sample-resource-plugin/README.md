# Resource Sharing and Access Control Plugin

This plugin demonstrates resource sharing and access control functionality, providing sample resource APIs and marking it as a resource sharing plugin via resource-sharing-spi. The access control is implemented on Security plugin and will be performed under the hood.
At present only admin and resource owners can modify/delete the resource

## PreRequisites

Publish SPI to local maven before proceeding:
```shell
./gradlew clean :opensearch-security-spi:publishToMavenLocal
```

System index feature must be enabled to prevent direct access to resource. Add the following setting in case it has not already been enabled.
```yml
plugins.security.system_indices.enabled: true
```

## Features

- Create, update, get, delete SampleResource, as well as share and revoke access to a resource.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:opensearch-project/security.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sample-resource-plugin
   ```

3. Build and deploy the plugin:
   ```bash
   $ ./gradlew clean build -x test -x integrationTest -x spotbugsIntegrationTest
   $ ./bin/opensearch-plugin install file: <path-to-this-plugin>/sample-resource-plugin/build/distributions/opensearch-sample-resource-plugin-<version-qualifier>.zip
   ```


## User setup:
1. **No Index-Level Permissions Required**
    - **Resource access is controlled at the cluster level**.
    - Users **do not** need explicit index-level permissions to access shared resources.

2. **Sample Role Configurations**
    - Below are **two sample roles** demonstrating how to configure permissions in `roles.yml`:

    ```yaml
    sample_full_access:
     cluster_permissions:
       - 'cluster:admin/sample-resource-plugin/*'

    sample_read_access:
     cluster_permissions:
       - 'cluster:admin/sample-resource-plugin/get'
    ```

4. **Interaction Rules**
    - If a **user is not the resource owner**, they must:
        - Be assigned **a role with `sample_read_access`** permissions.
        - **Have the resource shared with them** via the resource-sharing API.
    - A user **without** the necessary `sample-resource-plugin` cluster permissions:
        - **Cannot access the resource**, even if it is shared with them.
    - A user **with `sample-resource-plugin` permissions** but **without a shared resource**:
        - **Cannot access the resource**, since resource-level access control applies.
