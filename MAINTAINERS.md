### Updating Practices
To ensure common practices as maintainers, all practices are expected to be documented here or enforced through github actions.  There should be no expectations beyond what is documented in the repo [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and OpenSearch-Project [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/opensearch-project/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).  To modify an existing processes or create a new one, make a pull request on this MAINTAINERS.md for review and merge it after all maintainers approve of it.
