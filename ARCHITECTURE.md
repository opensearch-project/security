# OpenSearch Security Plugin Architecture

OpenSearchâ€™s core systems do not include security features, these features are added by installing the Security Plugin. The Security Plugin extends OpenSearch to provide authentication, authorization, end to end Encryption, audit logging, and management interfaces.

## Components

The Security Plugin is packaged into a standard plugin zip file used by OpenSearch which can be installed by using the plugin tool. The security configuration is accessible on disk for modification before the node has been turned on.  After node startup, the admin tools or API endpoints can be used for dynamic changes.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph OpenSearch Node
        subgraph File System
            cfg[Security Configuration files]
            adm[Admin Tools]
        end
        subgraph Indices
            idx(Index 1..n)
            secIdx[Security Index]
        end
        subgraph Plugins
           pgns(Plugins 1..n)
           sec[Security Plugin]
        end

        sec -- bootstrap security config --> cfg
        sec -- refresh security config from cluster --> secIdx
        adm -- backup/restore security config --> sec
    end
```

### Security Plugin

The runtime of the Security Plugin uses extension points to insert itself into the path actions. Several security management actions are registered in OpenSearch so they can be changed through REST API actions.

### Security Configuration

The security configuration is stored in an system index that is replicated to all nodes. When a change has been made to the configuration, the Security Plugin is reloaded to cleanly initialize its components with the new settings.

#### Configuration Files

When starting up with no security index detected in the cluster, the Security Plugin will attempt to load configuration files from disk into a new security index. The configuration files can be manually modified or sourced from a backup of a security index created using the admin tools.

### Admin Tools

For OpenSearch nodes to join a cluster, they need to have the same security configuration. Complete security configurations will include SSL settings and certificate files. The admin tools allow users to manage these settings and other features.

## Flows

### Authentication / Authorization

The Security Plugin supports multiple authentication backends including an internal identity provider which works with HTTP basic authentication as well as support [external providers](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/security/authentication-backends/authc-index/) such as OpenId Connect (OIDC) and SAML.

Authorization is governed by roles declared in the security configuration. Roles control resource access by referencing the transport action name and/or index names in combination with OpenSearch action names.

Users are assigned roles via the role mappings. These mappings include backend role assignments from authentication providers as well as internal roles defined in the Security Plugin.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    title Basic Authorization flow
    autonumber
    participant C as Client
    participant O as OpenSearch
    participant SP as Security Plugin
    participant RH as Request Handler
    participant AL as Audit Log

    C->>O: Request
    O->>SP: Request Received
    activate SP
    SP->>SP: Authenticate user via internal/external auth providers
    SP->>SP: Resolve Authorization for user
    SP-->>O: Allow/Deny request
    SP->>AL: Update Audit Log asynchronously
    deactivate SP
    O->>RH: Request continues to request handler
    RH-->>O: Result
    O->>C: Response
```

#### Multiple Authorization Provider flow

Based on the order within the Security Plugin's configuration authentication providers are iterated through to discover which provider can authenticate the user.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    title Multiple Authorization Provider flow
    autonumber
    participant C as Client
    participant SP as Security Plugin
    participant IAP as Internal Auth Provider
    participant EAP as External Auth Provider*
    participant SC as Security Configuration

    C->>SP: Incoming request
    SP->>IAP: Attempt to authenticate internally
    IAP-->>SP: Internal user result
    loop for each External Auth Provider
        SP->>EAP: Attempt to authenticate
        EAP-->>SP: External user result
    end
    SP->>SC: Check Authorization rules
    SC->>SC: Match user roles & permissions
    SC-->>SP: Authorization result
    SP-->>C: Response
```

#### Rest vs Transport flow

OpenSearch treats external REST requests differently than internal transport requests. While REST requests allow for client-to-node communication and make use of API routes, transport requests are more structured and are used to communicate between nodes.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    title Rest vs Transport Flow
    autonumber
    participant C as Client
    participant O as OpenSearch
    participant SP as Security Plugin (Rest Filter & Security Interceptor)
    participant AH as Action Handler

    C->>O: Request
    O->>SP: REST Request Received
    SP->>SP: If using client cert, Authenticate
    SP-->>O: Continue request
    O->>SP: Transport Request Received
    SP->>SP: Authenticate user via internal/external auth providers
    SP->>SP: Resolve Authorization for user
    SP-->>O: Allow/Deny request
    O->>AH: Send transport request to action handler
    AH-->>O: Result
    O->>C: Response
```

#### Plugin Authorization Flows

Plugins that implement ActionPlugin can register REST and Transport layer handlers which can receive requests from the user and other nodes in the cluster, respectively.  During the lifecycle of an incoming requests there are two standard ways to handle authorized actions in these flows.  One us to use the authenticated user, the other is to run outside the user context.

As in the normal authorization flow into the service the user is authenticated, then the action is determined, and finally an authorization check for the user is performed, and they are allowed or denied.  This can be thought of as running on behalf of the user.

There are some actions run by plugins that do not reuse the authentication or authorization of the current user, such as to make changes to internal cluster state for cross cluster replication.  When requests come in for these actions they are run outside the user context.

> Operating outside the user context means that no authorization checks are performed.  This is used to elevate plugin activities such as modifications to system indices, operations on the cluster configuration, and to ensure actions on the cluster are not associated with a singular user.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    title Authorization during action flow for Plugins
    autonumber
    participant C as Client
    participant OS as OpenSearch
    participant SP as SecurityPlugin
    participant P as Plugin

    C->>OS: Request
    OS->>SP: Request
    SP->>SP: Add Auth information to request context
    OS->>P: Client Request
    P->>SP: Execute transport layer action
    SP->>SP: Check if action is allowed
    alt Allowed
        SP->>OS: Continue request
        OS-->>P: Transport layer action result
    else Denied
        SP-->>OS: Return 403 Forbidden
        OS-->>C: 403 Forbidden
    end
    alt Plugin run outside user context
    P->>P: Stash context
    P->>SP: Execute transport layer action outside user context
    SP-->>SP: Check if action is allowed
    SP->>OS: Continue request
    OS-->>P: Transport layer action result
    P->>P: Restore user context
    end
    P-->>SP: Result
    SP-->>OS: Result
    OS-->>C: Result
```

#### Extension On Behalf Of Authorization Flows

Extensions will be able to operate in similar flows as Plugins to ensure authorization is correctly handled.  Registration of REST handlers is allowed and transport layer actions are not permitted.  After the request has been authorized for the user to be transmitted to the extension the token generator will create a just in time token for use with that request on behalf of the user.

> On Behalf Of tokens are an optional feature, while supported through the extensions API it needs to be enabled on an individual extension basis.  Issuing On Behalf Of tokens can be disabled which will alter request forward to the extension not to include the On Behalf Of token.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    title Authorization during action flow for Extension
    autonumber
    participant C as Client
    participant OS as OpenSearch
    participant SP as SecurityPlugin
    participant E as Extension

    C->>OS: Request
    OS->>SP: Request
    SP->>SP: Add Auth information from request context
    alt Allowed
        SP->>OS: Continue request
        OS-->>SP: Generate OnBehalfOf token for extension
        SP->>OS: Return OnBehalfOf token
        OS-->>E: Forward client Request with OnBehalfOf token
    else Denied
        note over E: Extension does not know<br>about denied requests
        SP-->>OS: Access denied
        OS-->>C: 403 Forbidden
    end

    E->>OS: Call OpenSearch REST API<br>with OnBehalfOf token
    OS->>SP: Request
    SP->>SP: Add Auth information from OnBehalfOf token
    alt Allowed
        SP->>OS: Continue request
        OS-->>E: Return REST API Action
        E->>OS: Return extension response
        OS->>C: Result
    else Denied
        SP-->>OS: Access denied
        OS-->>E: 403 Forbidden
        note over E: Extension responsible to understand<br>communicate failure response(s)
        E->>OS: Return extension response
        OS->>C: Result
    end
```

#### Extension Service Account Authorization

Service account information is provided to the extension on initialization.  This allows extension to make requests against the OpenSearch Cluster without needing an incoming request.  Since this request is down in the context of a different identity it can have different permissions from that of an On Behalf Of user such as modification to a persistent data store used by the extension.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    title Authorization with Service Account
    autonumber
    participant C as Client
    participant E as Extension
    participant OS as OpenSearch
    participant SP as SecurityPlugin

    OS->>OS: Initialize Extensions
    OS->>SP: Register extension service account
    SP->>OS: Service account token
    OS->>E: Initialization extension<br>include Service account token
    Note over E: Extension is initalized
    C->>E: Request
    E->>OS: Check extension data store<br>include Service account token
    OS->>SP: Request
    SP->>SP: Add Auth information from request context
    alt Allowed
        SP->>OS: Continue request
        OS->>E: REST API Result
    else Denied
        SP->>OS: Access denied
        OS->>E: 403 Forbidden
    end
    E->>C: Return extension response
```
