## Prerequisites
This project runs as a plugin of OpenSearch. You could [download a minimal release of OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/downloads.html#minimal) and then install the plugin there, but at this time there are no MacOS distributions (although you can run it as a docker container, but those images come with the security plugin already preinstalled). In addition, it might come in handy to be able to always run against the latest commit of the version under development, so we'll be compiling it from source instead.

To get started, follow the [getting started section](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#getting-started) of OpenSearch's developer guide. This will get you up and running with OpenSearch built from source code. Get to the point where you can run a successful `curl localhost:9200` call (you can skip the `./gradlew check` step to save some time. Great! now kill the server with `Ctrl+c` and copy the built code to a new folder somewhere else where you'll be running your service (run this from the base directory of the OpenSearch fork you cloned above):

```bash
export OPENSEARCH_HOME=~/Test/opensearch-1.3.0-SNAPSHOT
export OPENSEARCH_BUILD=distribution/archives/darwin-tar/build/install/opensearch-1.3.0-SNAPSHOT
cp -Rf $OPENSEARCH_BUILD $OPENSEARCH_HOME
```

Choose `$OPENSEARCH_HOME` as the base folder where your server will live, and adjust `$OPENSEARCH_BUILD` based on your version and OS (this is an example running on MacOS.)

Let's test it!

```bash
cd $OPENSEARCH_HOME
./bin/opensearch
```

The `curl localhost:9200` call from before should also succeed now. Kill the server again with `Ctrl+c`. We are ready to install the security plugin.

>Worth noting is that the version of OpenSearch and the security plugin must match as there is an explicit version check at startup. This can be a bit confusing as, for example, at the time of this writing the `main` branch of this security plugin builds version `1.3.0.0-SNAPSHOT`, compatible with OpenSearch `1.3.0-SNAPSHOT` that gets built from branch `1.x`. Check the expected compatible version [here](https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/blob/main/plugin-descriptor.properties#L27) and make sure you get the correct branch from OpenSearch when building that project.

## Building

First create a fork of this repo and clone it locally. Changing into the directory of the newly cloned repository, run the following to build the project:

```bash
mvn -B package -Padvanced -DskipTests
```

Install the built plugin into the OpenSearch server:

```bash
export OPENSEARCH_SECURITY_HOME=$OPENSEARCH_HOME/plugins/opensearch-security
cp target/releases/opensearch-security-1.3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.zip $OPENSEARCH_SECURITY_HOME
cd $OPENSEARCH_SECURITY_HOME
unzip opensearch-security-1.3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.zip
rm opensearch-security-1.3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.zip
```

You will have to adjust it to your specific version. In this example I'm using `1.3.0.0-SNAPSHOT`.

Install the demo certificates and default configuration, answer `y` to the first two questions and `n` to the last one:

```bash
./tools/install_demo_configuration.sh
OpenSearch Security Demo Installer
 ** Warning: Do not use on production or public reachable systems **
Install demo certificates? [y/N] y
Initialize Security Modules? [y/N] y
Cluster mode requires maybe additional setup of:
  - Virtual memory (vm.max_map_count)

Enable cluster mode? [y/N] n

### Success
### Execute this script now on all your nodes and then start all nodes
### OpenSearch Security will be automatically initialized.
### If you like to change the runtime configuration
### change the files in ../securityconfig and execute:
"/Users/XXXXX/Test/opensearch-1.3.0-SNAPSHOT/plugins/opensearch-security/tools/securityadmin.sh" -cd "/Users/XXXXX/Test/opensearch-1.3.0-SNAPSHOT/plugins/opensearch-security/securityconfig" -icl -key "/Users/XXXXX/Test/opensearch-1.3.0-SNAPSHOT/config/kirk-key.pem" -cert "/Users/XXXXX/Test/opensearch-1.3.0-SNAPSHOT/config/kirk.pem" -cacert "/Users/XXXXX/Test/opensearch-1.3.0-SNAPSHOT/config/root-ca.pem" -nhnv
### or run ./securityadmin_demo.sh
### To use the Security Plugin ConfigurationGUI
### To access your secured cluster open https://<hostname>:<HTTP port> and log in with admin/admin.
### (Ignore the SSL certificate warning because we installed self-signed demo certificates)
```

Now if we start our server again and try the original `curl localhost:9200`, it will fail. Try this one instead: `curl -XGET https://localhost:9200 -u 'admin:admin' --insecure`. You can also make this call to return the authenticated user details:

```bash
curl -XGET https://localhost:9200/_plugins/_security/authinfo -u 'admin:admin' --insecure

{
  "user": "User [name=admin, backend_roles=[admin], requestedTenant=null]",
  "user_name": "admin",
  "user_requested_tenant": null,
  "remote_address": "[::1]:57755",
  "backend_roles": [
    "admin"
  ],
  "custom_attribute_names": [],
  "roles": [
    "own_index",
    "all_access"
  ],
  "tenants": {
    "global_tenant": true,
    "admin_tenant": true,
    "admin": true
  },
  "principal": null,
  "peer_certificates": "0",
  "sso_logout_url": null
}
```
