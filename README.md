# OpenSearch Security Plugin

OpenSearch Security is a plugin for OpenSearch that offers encryption, authentication and authorization. When combined with OpenSearch Security-Advanced Modules, it supports authentication via Active Directory, LDAP, Kerberos, JSON web tokens, SAML, OpenID and more. It includes fine grained role-based access control to indices, documents and fields. It also provides multi-tenancy support in OpenSearch Dashboards.

## Installation

OpenSearch Security Plugin comes bundled by default as part of the OpenSearch distribution. Please refer to the [installation guide](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/install/index/) and  [technical documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/security-plugin/index/) for detailed information on installing and configuring the OpenSearch Security Plugin.

You can also see the [developer guide](https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/blob/main/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) which walks through the installation of the plugin for an OpenSearch server that doesn't initially have it.

## Test and Build

Run all tests:
```bash
./gradlew clean test
```

Run tests against local cluster:
```bash
./gradlew integTestRemote -Dtests.rest.cluster=localhost:9200 -Dtests.cluster=localhost:9200 -Dtests.clustername=docker-cluster -Dsecurity=true -Dhttps=true -Duser=admin -Dpassword=admin -Dcommon_utils.version="2.2.0.0"
```
OR
```bash
./scripts/integtest.sh
```
Note: To run against a remote cluster replace cluster-name and `localhost:9200` with the IPAddress:Port of that cluster.

Build artifacts (zip, deb, rpm):
```bash
./gradlew clean assemble
artifact_zip=`ls $(pwd)/build/distributions/opensearch-security-*.zip | grep -v admin-standalone`
./gradlew buildDeb buildRpm -ParchivePath=$artifact_zip
```

This produces:

```
build/releases/opensearch-security-<VERSION>.zip
build/distributions/opensearch-security-<VERSION>.deb
build/distributions/opensearch-security-<VERSION>.rpm
```

## Config hot reloading

The Security Plugin configuration is stored in a dedicated index in OpenSearch itself. Changes to the configuration are pushed to this index via the command line tool. This triggers a reload of the configuration on all nodes automatically. This has several advantages over configuration via `opensearch.yml`:

* Configuration is stored in a central place
* No configuration files on the nodes necessary
* Configuration changes do not require a restart
* Configuration changes take effect immediately

## Onboarding new APIs

It is common practice to create new transport actions to perform different tasks between nodes when developing new APIs. For any new or existing plugins that want to onboard & integrate these actions with security, they should follow the steps below:
1. Name your action ([example](https://github.com/opensearch-project/anomaly-detection/blob/main/src/main/java/org/opensearch/ad/transport/SearchADTasksAction.java#L35)), and register it ([example](https://github.com/opensearch-project/anomaly-detection/blob/main/src/main/java/org/opensearch/ad/AnomalyDetectorPlugin.java#L935)) in your plugin. Best practice is to follow existing naming conventions, which follow a hierarchical pattern to keep the action names organized between different plugins.
2. Register the action in the [OpenSearch Security plugin](https://github.com/opensearch-project/security). Each new action is registered in the plugin as a new permission. Usually, plugins will define different roles for their plugin (e.g., read-only access, write access). Each role will contain a set of permissions. An example of adding a new permission to the `anomaly_read_access` role for the [Anomaly Detection plugin](https://github.com/opensearch-project/anomaly-detection) can be found in [this PR](https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/pull/997/files).
3. Register the action in the [OpenSearch Dashboards Security plugin](https://github.com/opensearch-project/security-dashboards-plugin). This plugin maintains the full list of possible permissions, so users can see all of them when creating new roles or searching permissions via Dashboards. An example of adding different permissions can be found in [this PR](https://github.com/opensearch-project/security-dashboards-plugin/pull/689/files).

```

### System Index Protection

The Security Plugin provides protection to system indices used by plugins. The system index names must be explicitly registered in `opensearch.yml` under the `plugins.security.system_indices.indices` setting. See below for an example setup of system index protection from the demo configuration:

```
plugins.security.system_indices.enabled: true
plugins.security.system_indices.indices: [".plugins-ml-model", ".plugins-ml-task", ".opendistro-alerting-config", ".opendistro-alerting-alert*", ".opendistro-anomaly-results*", ".opendistro-anomaly-detector*", ".opendistro-anomaly-checkpoints", ".opendistro-anomaly-detection-state", ".opendistro-reports-*", ".opensearch-notifications-*", ".opensearch-notebooks", ".opensearch-observability", ".opendistro-asynchronous-search-response*", ".replication-metadata-store"]
```

The demo configuration can be modified in the following files to add a new system index to the demo configuration:

- https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/blob/main/tools/install_demo_configuration.sh
- https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/blob/main/tools/install_demo_configuration.bat
