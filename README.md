# OpenSearch Security Plugin

OpenSearch Security is a plugin for OpenSearch that offers encryption, authentication and authorization. When combined with OpenSearch Security-Advanced Modules, it supports authentication via Active Directory, LDAP, Kerberos, JSON web tokens, SAML, OpenID and more. It includes fine grained role-based access control to indices, documents and fields. It also provides multi-tenancy support in OpenSearch Dashboards.

## Installation

OpenSearch Security Plugin comes bundled by default as part of the OpenSearch distribution. Please refer to the [installation guide](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/install/index/) and  [technical documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/security-plugin/index/) for detailed information on installing and configuring the OpenSearch Security Plugin.

You can also see the [developer guide](https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/blob/main/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) which walks through the installation of the plugin for an OpenSearch server that doesn't initially have it.

## Test and Build

Run all tests:
```bash
mvn clean test
```

Build artifacts (zip, deb, rpm):
```bash
mvn clean package -Padvanced -DskipTests
artifact_zip=`ls $(pwd)/target/releases/opensearch-security-*.zip | grep -v admin-standalone`
./gradlew build buildDeb buildRpm --no-daemon -ParchivePath=$artifact_zip -Dbuild.snapshot=false
```

This produces:

```
target/releases/opensearch-security-<VERSION>.zip
gradle-build/distributions/opensearch-security-<VERSION>.deb
gradle-build/distributions/opensearch-security-<VERSION>.rpm
```

## Config hot reloading

The Security Plugin configuration is stored in a dedicated index in OpenSearch itself. Changes to the configuration are pushed to this index via the command line tool. This triggers a reload of the configuration on all nodes automatically. This has several advantages over configuration via `opensearch.yml`:

* Configuration is stored in a central place
* No configuration files on the nodes necessary
* Configuration changes do not require a restart
* Configuration changes take effect immediately
