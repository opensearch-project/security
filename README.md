## OpenSearch Security

OpenSearch Security is an OpenSearch plugin that offers encryption, authentication, and authorization. When combined with OpenSearch Security-Advanced Modules, it supports authentication via Active Directory, LDAP, Kerberos, JSON web tokens, SAML, OpenID and more. It includes fine grained role-based access control to indices, documents and fields. It also provides multi-tenancy support in OpenSearch Dashboards.

* User Impersonation
* Active Directory / LDAP
* Kerberos / SPNEGO
* JSON web token (JWT)
* OpenID Connect (OIDC)
* SAML

### Access control:
* Role-based cluster level access control
* Role-based index level access control
* User-, role- and permission management
* Document-level security
* Field-level security
* REST management API

### Audit/Compliance logging:

## Documentation

Please refer to the [technical documentation](https://docs-beta.opensearch.org/docs/security/configuration/) for detailed information on installing and configuring opensearch-security plugin.

## Quick Start

* Install OpenSearch

* Install the opensearch-security plugin for your OpenSearch version 1.0.0-beta1, e.g.:

```
<OpenSearch directory>/bin/opensearch-plugin install \
  -b org.opensearch:opensearch-security:1.0.0.0-beta1
```

* ``cd`` into ``<OpenSearch directory>/plugins/opensearch-security/tools``

* Execute ``./install_demo_configuration.sh``, ``chmod`` the script first if necessary. This will generate all required TLS certificates and add the Security Plugin Configuration to your ``opensearch.yml`` file. 

* Start OpenSearch

* Test the installation by visiting ``https://localhost:9200``. When prompted, use admin/admin as username and password. This user has full access to the cluster.

* Display information about the currently logged in user by visiting ``https://localhost:9200/_plugins/_security/authinfo``.

## Test and Build

* Run all tests

```
mvn clean test
```

* Build artifacts (zip, deb, rpm)

```
mvn clean package -Padvanced -DskipTests
artifact_zip=`ls $(pwd)/target/releases/opensearch-security-*.zip | grep -v admin-standalone`
./gradlew build buildDeb buildRpm --no-daemon -ParchivePath=$artifact_zip -Dbuild.snapshot=false
```

## Config hot reloading

The Security Plugin Configuration is stored in a dedicated index in OpenSearch itself. Changes to the configuration are pushed to this index via the command line tool. This will trigger a reload of the configuration on all nodes automatically. This has several advantages over configuration via opensearch.yml:

* Configuration is stored in a central place
* No configuration files on the nodes necessary
* Configuration changes do not require a restart
* Configuration changes take effect immediately
