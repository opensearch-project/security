## Documentation

Please refer to the [technical documentation](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs) for detailed information on installing and configuring opendistro-elasticsearch-security plugin.

## Quick Start

* Install Elasticsearch

* Install the opendistro-elasticsearch-security plugin for your Elasticsearch version 6.5.4, e.g.:

```
<ES directory>/bin/elasticsearch-plugin install \
  -b com.amazon.opendistroforelasticsearch:elasticsearch-security:0.7.0.0
```

* ``cd`` into ``<ES directory>/plugins/opendistro_security/tools``

* Execute ``./install_demo_configuration.sh``, ``chmod`` the script first if necessary. This will generate all required TLS certificates and add the Security Plugin Configurationto your ``elasticsearch.yml`` file. 

* Start Elasticsearch

* Test the installation by visiting ``https://localhost:9200``. When prompted, use admin/admin as username and password. This user has full access to the cluster.

* Display information about the currently logged in user by visiting ``https://localhost:9200/_opendistro/_security/authinfo``.


## Config hot reloading

The Security Plugin Configuration is stored in a dedicated index in Elasticsearch itself. Changes to the configuration are pushed to this index via the command line tool. This will trigger a reload of the configuration on all nodes automatically. This has several advantages over configuration via elasticsearch.yml:

* Configuration is stored in a central place
* No configuration files on the nodes necessary
* Configuration changes do not require a restart
* Configuration changes take effect immediately
