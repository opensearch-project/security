/**
 * Evaluates access to resources. The resource plugins must register the indices which hold resource information.
 *
 * It is separate from normal index access evaluation and takes into account access-levels defined when sharing a resource.
 * For example, a user with no roles associated at all, will still be able to access a resource if shared with.
 *
 * Resource could be shared at multiple access levels, and the access will be evaluated for the level it is shared at
 * regardless of the actions associated with the roles, if any, mapped to the user.
 *
 * NOTE: It is recommended to keep system index protection on, and this evaluator assumes that it is.
 * Without it, normal users with index permission may be able to modify the sharing records directly.
