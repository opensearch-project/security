## How we work

#### Quality and security form the foundation of our efforts
* We deliver quality security solutions by understanding issues thoroughly, acting iteratively, and validating solutions through rigorous testing.
* We hold security to the highest standards of quality. Quality is the first step in building trust with users, stakeholders, and our community as a whole.
* We move swiftly to solve problems. But we don’t sacrifice quality to achieve quick wins, meet performance indicators, or get the bragging rights related to launching popular, high-profile features.



#### Privacy won’t be compromised
* Privacy is a key part of security, and we make sure it isn’t compromised in the pursuit of creating benefits.
* When we make decisions, we carefully consider any potential impacts to privacy and make sure those decisions protect our users’ and stakeholders’ data.
* We maintain a focus on creating software that empowers cluster administrators to keep their sensitive data safe.



#### Transparent collaboration creates secure outcomes
* Transparent collaboration promotes community inclusion, creates a space for concise and authentic communication, and supports accountability.
* We operate through transparent collaboration. We believe a secure product is built through diverse perspectives, knowledge sharing, candid discussions, and doing our work in the open when and where it’s safe to do so.
* We are relationship builders who create safe, respectful, and accessible spaces for everyone so we can engage and work towards the common goal of building secure solutions.
* When circumstances do require privacy, we make every effort to quickly resolve those requirements and return circumstances to a state of full visibility with our community and collaborators.
