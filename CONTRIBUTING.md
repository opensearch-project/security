## Contributing to this Project

OpenSearch is a community project that is built and maintained by people just like **you**.

The brief summary below outlines some of the ways you can contribute.

_Note: In any case where this document conflicts directly with the policies outlined by the main [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/opensearch-project/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document for OpenSearch, the latter will always hold precedent._

## Code Submission

The most direct way to contribute to this project is through code submission. Code submission helps to improve the code base as well as add new features and tests.
Code submissions should respect the following guidelines:

* Code should be relevant to the OpenSearch project and either address an existing issue or demonstrate a benefit to the project.
* New code should be thoroughly tested and documented in accordance with the pull request guidelines.
* Pull requests must be reviewed by two others and the maintainers of the code base reserve the right to refuse any code submission without explanation.
* Submissions should be written in a standardized style which preserves the maintainability of the codebase for future developers.
* Submissions should be focused on a single issue or feature.

## Code Reviewal

Code review is another way for individuals to contribute to the project. As mentioned in the Code Submission section, all pull requests must be reviewed by at least two other contributors before they can be merged.
Code review can cover a variety of aspects of a piece of code and functions to mitigate the chance of unintentionally breaking the codebase as well as introducing un-tenable code.
When Code Reviewing there are a number of things that contributors should keep in mind:

* Code should be easy to interpret and pass all automated tests.
* Asking questions of the code author is encouraged; if something is not clear to you, it probably is not to others.
* Code should have thorough testing.
* Pull requests should be proposed for the appropriate project branch (i.e. breaking changes for the next major release belong in the `main` branch).

## Maintainership

Along with the code review that any contributor can participate in, there are also individuals who have qualified for the role of a repository maintainer. A list of OpenSearch-Security maintainers can be found in [MAINTAINERS.md](./MAINTAINERS.md). Anyone can become a maintainer through the process outlined in the OpenSearch [MAINTAINERS.md](https://github.com/opensearch-project/.github/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md).

## Triaging

OpenSearch-Security seeks to promote an inclusive and engaged community of contributors. In order to facilitate this, weekly triage meetings are open-to-all and attendance is encouraged for anyone who hopes to contribute, discuss an issue, or learn more about the project.
Meeting links are regularly updated and posted on the [Upcoming Events](https://opensearch.org/events) webpage.
