## Proposal
 
 This document outlines proposed changes towards creating more _open_ security and securtity dashboard repositories. Specifically, the initiative seeks to: 
 
 * Establish use of a publically accessible Slack channel for communication between the Amazon OpenSearch Security Team and other OpenSearch users
 * Invite the public to attend weekly triage meetings where they may participate in the prioritization and organization of active issues
 * Incorporate a weekly "Office Hours" meeting into the newly proposed secondary oncall cycle where community members can come to further discuss current OpenSearch Security issues


## Need

Before making any major changes, it is important to provide context to the necessity of those changes. To this point, several factors make the _opening_ of OpenSearch Security needed.
In no particular order, the needs soliciting this change include: 

* Increasing the community engagment with the project--though the OpenSearch Security team is employed by Amazon, valuable contributions from all types of users are fundamental to the projects values and goals
* Encouraging the promotion of non-Amazon community members to __Maintainer__ status
* Improving communication on current issues in order to ensure OpenSearch is constantly inventing and iterating at a rapid rate
* Promoting ownership by both the Amazon OpenSearch Security team and the external contributors who submit code and issues
* Better identifying the most pressing pain-points for OpenSearch adopters and ensuring that the best possible experience is delivered


## Adoption

It is one thing to propose a change and another to see it through. In order to ensure the _opening_ of OpenSearch Security there are several potential issues that deserve premptive addressing.
Concerns about the adoption of this proposal include:

* Ensuring equitable access: We do not want to favor one group of users over another simply because they are able to attend a meeting while the latter group cannot. To this point, it is important that triaging practices continue to be made 
  with the goal of prioritzing the issues that are most important to the largest number of users at a time and/or are the most actionable. 
* Avoiding monopolization: Similar to the previous point, it is important that meetings do not become an opportunity for misbehavior which puts one user's personal interests above the needs of the 
  community as a whole. While community members are encouraged to attend and advocate for issues they are passionate about, attempts to commandeer meetings or dialogue are innapropriate and may result 
  in an indivdual being asked to leave meetings.
* Appropriate use of time: When inviting more active contribution from more users, it is obvious that more time may be required for certain meetings. We ask that all attendees regardless of affiliation 
  keep their points and comments succint and focused on the completion of daily tasks. The more time spent talking, the less time everyone has to contribute to the project. 
* Question types: Again relating to the previous note, it is important that questions and comments are in-line with the explicit purpose of each meeting. If it is a "Triage Meeting," questions about implementing existing security 
  features should be addressed in an appropriate manner either during "Office Hour" meetings by the oncall team member or through another channel such as Slack. Likewise, Slack is probably not the best place 
  to ask about when "issue _n_" will be looked at. 
  
  
## Feedback

As with any proposal or project, it is important for iteration and improvement to take place so please use this opportunity to suggest changes or raise concerns related to the topics discussed above. 


## Next Steps 

The first concrete steps towards implementing these changes have taken place with advice having been gathered from other organizations who participate in an open source manner. 
Advice has been received from members of the following groups regarding _opening_ OpenSearch Security: Jupyer; Amazon Chime SDK; OpenSearch Core; Amazon Linux; Amazon Product Marketing; AWS Scheduling; Amazon Open Source Observabilty. 
An open OpenSearch Slack channel is being created and the above steps were all suggested by members of other teams with existing framework.
